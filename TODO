- we need to have the ability to restart "active" loops that were interrupted for some reason
- we need to stream events properly
- we need to clean up the client
- we need to clean up the idle timeout

---------------------
- loop management with persistence 
    - pause loops and move to IDLE
    - discover running loops and restart them on startup (or move to IDLE)
    - set MAX idle timeout
- sse for events
    - stream events to client from event history - WIP
- bubble up more fastapi controls to route
   - add whatever we need here
- loop -> loop switching and sessions pass through
- multi worker client loading
